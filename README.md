<h1>Hi, I'm Brandon! 🌐</h1>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/codewithbrandon">SOC Analyst</a> | <a>CompTia Security+</a> | <a> Top Secret Clearance</a></h2>

<h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
<p>I am a dedicated professional successfully leveraging over 20 years of experience in high-stakes, process-driven environments (Federal Investigation, TSA, Logistics) into Cybersecurity Operations.

As a former Top Secret Cleared Contractor, my foundation is built on procedural rigor, data confidentiality, and mission-critical execution. My extensive investigative background directly translates to advanced alert triage and anomaly detection, focusing on the correlation of disparate data points to uncover complex security risks. I now focus my technical skills on SIEM operations, Python scripting, and network analysis to contribute immediately to a security team.</p>

My background gives me a distinct advantage in the SOC

<ul>
  <li>Investigative Mindset: Proven ability to gather facts, correlate disparate data points, and identify anomalies under strict regulatory frameworks.</li>

  <li>Procedural Adherence: Expert in following rigorous, defined protocols (critical for Incident Response Playbooks).</li>

  <li>High Attention to Detail: Trained to spot subtle exceptions in massive data flows (essential for alert triage).</li>
</ul>

I am actively building a foundational technical skillset focused on SIEM, Linux, and Python to achieve a remote SOC Analyst role.
